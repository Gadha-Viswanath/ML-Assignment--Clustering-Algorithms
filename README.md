# ML-Assignment--Clustering-Algorithms
The repository is created to evaluate the understanding and ability to apply clustering techniques to a real-world dataset.
 Iris dataset available in the sklearn library is used here. Key components fulfilled :

1.Loading and Preprocessing: Loaded the Iris dataset from sklearn. Dropped the species column since this is a clustering problem.
2.Clustering Algorithm Implementation: Implemented the following two clustering algorithms:

A) KMeans Clustering : Provided a brief description of how KMeans clustering works. Explained why KMeans clustering might be suitable for the Iris dataset. Applied KMeans clustering to the preprocessed Iris dataset and visualized the clusters.

B) Hierarchical Clustering : Provided a brief description of how Hierarchical clustering works. Explained why Hierarchical clustering might be suitable for the Iris dataset. Appled Hierarchical clustering to the preprocessed Iris dataset and visualized the clusters.
